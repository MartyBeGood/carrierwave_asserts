Now in your main program you can just require your module and give it any file to parse. In Rails, we would probably put a module like this in the lib folder. You can create large module 'libraries' consisting of many nested modules and classes. Here is a more complex example module used for processing data.May 5, 2016

bundle gem carrierwave_asserts
add code
gem build carrierwave_asserts.gemspec
gem install carrierwave_asserts-0.1.0.gem
add this to a local rails Gemfile
gem 'carrierwave_asserts' -->

I got this error because I hadn't commited my updates with git yet.

s.files         = `git ls-files`.split("\n")
That line is directly using git, and probably causing this error. Just do

git add .
git commit -a -m "init"
